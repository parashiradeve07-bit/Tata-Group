<p>
One of the most diversified integrated steel producers with a capacity of 35 MTPA across India, the Netherlands, the UK, and Thailand, Tata Steel is shaping a better tomorrow through innovation, sustainability, and an enduring commitment to excellence.
</p>
<p>
In India, Tata Steel operates in Jamshedpur and Gamharia in Jharkhand, as well as in Kalinganagar and Meramandali in Odisha, with an overall capacity of 26.6 MTPA.
</p>
<p>
The acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited has strengthened the Company's capabilities in the long products segment. Additionally, the Company has downstream manufacturing facilities for wires, tubes, bearings, agricultural equipment, pig iron, ductile iron (DI) pipes, and various industrial by-products. The Company's operations include Tata Growth Shop, a heavy-duty engineering and fabrication business, and a Ferro Alloys and Minerals Division.
</p>
<p>
The Company has extensive captive mining operations in the upstream segment, including collieries in Jharia and West Bokaro, and iron ore mines in Noamundi, Katamati, Joda East, Khondbond, Vijaya II, and Koida in India. Internationally, it operates iron ore assets in Labrador and Northern Quebec, Canada.
</p>
<p>
Driven by a vision to achieve 40 MTPA capacity in India, Tata Steel is actively pursuing growth through both organic and inorganic avenues. As part of the Phase II expansion of Tata Steel Kalinganagar—from 3 to 8 MTPA—the Company commissioned India’s largest blast furnace in FY2024-25, with rampup to full capacity currently in progress.</p>
<p>
In the UK, Tata Steel is transitioning to a 3.2 MTPA electric arc furnace-based steelmaking route, following the decommissioning of its heavy-end assets during the year under review.
</p>
<p>
Tata Steel Nederland has submitted its Green Steel Plan to the Dutch Government, outlining its proposal to replace one of its blast furnaces with a direct reduced iron (DRI)–electric arc furnace (EAF) configuration.
</p>
<p>
Tata Steel has set an ambitious target of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2045. Through a steadfast focus on sustainability, innovation, agility, and fostering deep relationships with customers and communities, the Company's goal is to become the most respected and valuable metals & mining company globally.</p.
